Stock price prediction using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),
involves leveraging the power of CNN
which are primarily used in image recognition tasks, 
to analyze historical stock price data. 
In this approach, the time series data is treated as an image,
where each data point corresponds to a pixel.
The CNN learns features from these "images" to predict future stock prices. 
This method can capture complex patterns and dependencies in the data, 
potentially leading to more accurate predictions compared to traditional methods.
The dataset used here is "yfinance".
